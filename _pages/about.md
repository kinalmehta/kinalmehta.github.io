I am an MS-CS Research student at IIIT Hyderabad. Currently I am studying the foundation coursework. I aim to work on learning in autonomous agents, continual learning, intrinsic motivation learning.

Not much active on blogs yet, but I plan to improve on that front and keep posting about interesting topics related to learning algorithms and my research.

When I am not working, you can find me playing chess.

My background and history
-------------------------

I received my BE in Electronics and Telecommunications from Savitribai Phule Pune University after which I did my Postgraduate Diploma in Big Data Analytics at CDAC ACTS.

After studies, I joined CDAC Graphics and Intelligence based Script Technology group where I worked on developing several deep learning based applications for Indian Languages such as tranliteration, POS/NER tagging, etc.

I also had the opportunity to work on several image processing based applications like realtime person detection, tracking and counting, face deduplication on huge datasets and crowd density estimation.

After CDAC I worked with several start-ups and then finally joined IIIT Hyderabad as MS by Research student to pursue research in learning algorithms.
